With this project I went a bit further with by using cool functions that I don't use often. For data processing I used Xlookup, 
this new gen function basically fetch data both horizontally and vertically. 
I also used INDEX and Match functions together to fetch data from other excel sheet. Lastly some formulas for basic results.

For designing and pivot chart formatting I chose more detailing and designing.

Thank you for viewing my project.
